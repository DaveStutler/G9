# Analysis on the Particle collider dataset

Abstract

We have two datasets, `Collider_spherical.root` and `Collider_linear.root`. The project idea is to analyze the datasets on the shape of explosions from a particle collider in order to determine what aspects of the particles used and conditions influence the shape of the collision. These findings would be significant because they can help researchers determine the collider type they should use when looking to collide two particles. We are not fully certain on what machine learning model we will use, but are considering unsupervised learning by applying a neural network to the data to identify correlations and connections between data points. 

Challenges:


Short description of data:
`Collider_spherical.root`:
`Collider_linear.root`:

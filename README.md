#Analysis on the Particle collider dataset

Abstract 

We have two potential projects and datasets, with the second being a backup idea in case we are not able to successfully convert the first dataset into a csv file as we are currently trying to do. The main project idea is to analyze a dataset on the shape of explosions (spherical or linear) from a particle collider in order to determine what aspects of the particles used and conditions influence the shape of the collision. These findings would be significant because they can help researchers determine the collider type they should use when looking to collide two particles. We are not fully certain on what machine learning model we will use, but are considering unsupervised learning by applying a neural network to the data to identify correlations and connections between data points. The backup project idea would be to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon reviews in order to classify the reviews as either positive, negative, or neutral. 


Short description of data:
Particle Collider dataset:~60,000 particle collision events featuring candidate D0 Mesons decaying into a Kaon and a Pion. Features include the momenta, time, and energy of particles at detection. 1 file, 1.3MB.

Amazon dataset: 34,000 reviews of Amazon products. Features include the rating, review, and product description
